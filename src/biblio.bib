  abstract = {Max-stable processes are the natural extension of the classical extreme-value distributions to the functional setting, and they are increasingly widely used to estimate probabilities of complex extreme events. In this paper we broaden them from the usual situation in which dependence varies according to functions of Euclidean distance to situations in which extreme river discharges at two locations on a river network may be dependent because the locations are flow-connected or because of common meteorological events. In the former case dependence depends on river distance, and in the second it depends on the hydrological distance between the locations, either of which may be very different from their Euclidean distance. Inference for the model parameters is performed using a multivariate threshold likelihood, which is shown by simulation to work well. The ideas are illustrated with data from the upper Danube basin.},

  abstract = {Estimation of extreme-value parameters from observations in the max-domain of attraction (MDA) of a multivariate max-stable distribution commonly uses aggregated data such as block maxima. Since we expect that additional information is contained in the non-aggregated, single "large" observations, we introduce a new approach of inference based on a multivariate peaks-over-threshold method. We show that for any process in the MDA of the frequently used H{\textbackslash}"usler-Reiss model or its spatial extension, the Brown-Resnick process, suitably defined conditional increments asymptotically follow a multivariate Gaussian distribution. This leads to computationally efficient estimates of the H{\textbackslash}"usler-Reiss parameter matrix. Further, the results enable parametric inference for Brown-Resnick processes. A simulation study compares the performance of the new estimators to other commonly used methods. As an application, we fit a non-isotropic Brown-Resnick process to the extremes of 12 year data of daily wind speed measurements.},

The theory of multivariate and spatial extremes describes the risk of rare events through asymptotically justified limit models such as max-stable and multivariate Pareto distributions. Statistical modelling in this field has been limited to moderate dimensions so far, partly owing to complicated likelihoods and a lack of understanding of the underlying probabilistic structures. We introduce a general theory of conditional independence for multivariate Pareto distributions that enables the definition of graphical models and sparsity for extremes. A Hammersley--Clifford theorem links this new notion to the factorization of densities of extreme value models on graphs. For the popular class of H{\"u}sler--Reiss distributions we show that, similarly to the Gaussian case, the sparsity pattern of a general extremal graphical model can be read off from suitable inverse covariance matrices. New parametric models can be built in a modular way and statistical inference can be simplified to lower dimensional marginals. We discuss learning of minimum spanning trees and model selection for extremal graph structures, and we illustrate their use with an application to flood risk assessment on the Danube river.},

The importance of such measures stems from their connection to infinitely divisible and max-infinitely divisible distributions, where they appear as L{\textbackslash}'evy measures and exponent measures, respectively. We characterize independence and conditional independence for \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$ in various ways through kernels and factorization of a modified density, including a Hammersley-Clifford type theorem for undirected graphical models. As opposed to the classical conditional independence, our notion is intimately connected to the support of the measure \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$. Our general theory unifies and extends recent approaches to graphical modeling in the fields of extreme value analysis and L{\textbackslash}'evy processes. Our results for the corresponding undirected and directed graphical models lay the foundation for new statistical methodology in these areas.},

In both cases, we describe model properties, methods for statistical inference on known graph structures, and structure learning algorithms when the graph is unknown.

While theory and statistical tools for univariate extremes are well-developed, methods for high-dimensional and complex data sets are still scarce. Appropriate notions of sparsity and connections to other fields such as machine learning, graphical models and high-dimensional statistics have only recently been established. This article reviews the new domain of research concerned with the detection and modeling of sparse patterns in rare events. We first describe the different forms of extremal dependence that can arise between the largest observations of a multivariate random vector. We then discuss the current research topics including clustering, principal component analysis and graphical modeling for extremes. Identification of groups of variables which can be concomitantly extreme is also addressed. The methods are illustrated with an application to flood risk assessment.},

We show that sample versions of the extremal correlation and a new summary statistic, which we call the extremal variogram, can be used as weights for a minimum spanning tree to consistently recover the true underlying tree. Remarkably, this implies that extremal tree models can be learned in a completely non-parametric fashion by using simple summary statistics and without the need to assume discrete distributions, existence of densities, or parametric models for bivariate distributions.},

The H{\textbackslash}"usler-Reiss distribution is a versatile model for this extremal dependence, and it is usually parameterized by a variogram matrix. In order to represent conditional independence relations and obtain sparse parameterizations, we introduce the novel H{\textbackslash}"usler-Reiss precision matrix. Similarly to the Gaussian case, this matrix appears naturally in density representations of the H{\textbackslash}"usler-Reiss Pareto distribution and encodes the extremal graphical structure through its zero pattern. For a given, arbitrary graph we prove the existence and uniqueness of the completion of a partially specified H{\textbackslash}"usler-Reiss variogram matrix so that its precision matrix has zeros on non-edges in the graph. Using suitable estimators for the parameters on the edges, our theory provides the first consistent estimator of graph structured H{\textbackslash}"usler-Reiss distributions. If the graph is unknown, our method can be combined with recent structure learning algorithms to jointly infer the graph and the corresponding parameter matrix. Based on our methodology, we propose new tools for statistical inference of sparse H{\textbackslash}"usler-Reiss models and illustrate them on large flight delay data in the U.S., as well as Danube river flow data.},

One approach is based on modelling exceedances of a random variable over a high threshold with the generalized Pareto (GP) distribution.

We introduce a multivariate analogue of the GP distribution and show that it is characterized by each of following two properties: first, exceedances asymptotically have a multivariate GP distribution if and only if maxima asymptotically are extreme value distributed; and second, the multivariate GP distribution is the only one which is preserved under change of exceedance levels. We also discuss a bivariate example and lower-dimensional marginal distributions.},
