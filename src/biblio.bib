  abstract = {Max-stable processes are the natural extension of the classical extreme-value distributions to the functional setting, and they are increasingly widely used to estimate probabilities of complex extreme events. In this paper we broaden them from the usual situation in which dependence varies according to functions of Euclidean distance to situations in which extreme river discharges at two locations on a river network may be dependent because the locations are flow-connected or because of common meteorological events. In the former case dependence depends on river distance, and in the second it depends on the hydrological distance between the locations, either of which may be very different from their Euclidean distance. Inference for the model parameters is performed using a multivariate threshold likelihood, which is shown by simulation to work well. The ideas are illustrated with data from the upper Danube basin.},

  abstract = {In a wide range of applications, from climate science to finance, extreme events with a non-negligible probability can occur, leading to disastrous consequences. Extremes in climatic events such as wind, temperature, and precipitation can profoundly impact humans and ecosystems, resulting in events like floods, landslides, or heatwaves. When the focus is on studying variables measured over time at numerous specific locations, such as the previously mentioned variables, partitioning these variables becomes essential to summarize and visualize spatial trends, which is crucial in the study of extreme events. This thesis explores several models and methods for partitioning the variables of a multivariate stationary process, focusing on extreme dependencies.Chapter 1 introduces the concepts of modeling dependence through copulas, which are fundamental for extreme dependence. The notion of regular variation, essential for studying extremes, is introduced, and weakly dependent processes are discussed. Partitioning is examined through the paradigms of separation-proximity and model-based clustering. Non-asymptotic analysis is also addressed to evaluate our methods in fixed dimensions.Chapter 2 study the dependence between maximum values is crucial for risk analysis. Using the extreme value copula function and the madogram, this chapter focuses on non-parametric estimation with missing data. A functional central limit theorem is established, demonstrating the convergence of the madogram to a tight Gaussian process. Formulas for asymptotic variance are presented, illustrated by a numerical study.Chapter 3 proposes asymptotically independent block (AI-block) models for partitioning variables, defining clusters based on the independence of maxima. An algorithm is introduced to recover clusters without specifying their number in advance. Theoretical efficiency of the algorithm is demonstrated, and a data-driven parameter selection method is proposed. The method is applied to neuroscience and environmental data, showcasing its potential.Chapter 4 adapts partitioning techniques to analyze composite extreme events in European climate data. Sub-regions with dependencies in extreme precipitation and wind speed are identified using ERA5 data from 1979 to 2022. The obtained clusters are spatially concentrated, offering a deep understanding of the regional distribution of extremes. The proposed methods efficiently reduce data size while extracting critical information on extreme events.Chapter 5 proposes a new estimation method for matrices in a latent factor linear model, where each component of a random vector is expressed by a linear equation with factors and noise. Unlike classical approaches based on joint normality, we assume factors are distributed according to standard Fr{\'e}chet distributions, allowing a better description of extreme dependence. An estimation method is proposed, ensuring a unique solution under certain conditions. An adaptive upper bound for the estimator is provided, adaptable to dimension and the number of factors.},

  abstract = {Motivated by modern applications in which one constructs graphical models based on a very large number of features, this paper introduces a new class of cluster-based graphical models, in which variable clustering is applied as an initial step for reducing the dimension of the feature space. We employ model assisted clustering, in which the clusters contain features that are similar to the same unobserved latent variable. Two different cluster-based Gaussian graphical models are considered: the latent variable graph, corresponding to the graphical model associated with the unobserved latent variables, and the cluster-average graph, corresponding to the vector of features averaged over clusters. Our study reveals that likelihood based inference for the latent graph, not analyzed previously, is analytically intractable. Our main contribution is the development and analysis of alternative estimation and inference strategies, for the precision matrix of an unobservable latent vector \$Z\$. We replace the likelihood of the data by an appropriate class of empirical risk functions, that can be specialized to the latent graphical model and to the simpler, but under-analyzed, cluster-average graphical model. The estimators thus derived can be used for inference on the graph structure, for instance on edge strength or pattern recovery. Inference is based on the asymptotic limits of the entry-wise estimates of the precision matrices associated with the conditional independence graphs under consideration. While taking the uncertainty induced by the clustering step into account, we establish Berry-Esseen central limit theorems for the proposed estimators. It is noteworthy that, although the clusters are estimated adaptively from the data, the central limit theorems regarding the entries of the estimated graphs are proved under the same conditions one would use if the clusters were known....},

Since we expect that additional information is contained in the non-aggregated, single "large" observations, we introduce a new approach of inference based on a multivariate peaks-over-threshold method. We show that for any process in the MDA of the frequently used H{\textbackslash}"usler-Reiss model or its spatial extension, the Brown-Resnick process, suitably defined conditional increments asymptotically follow a multivariate Gaussian distribution. This leads to computationally efficient estimates of the H{\textbackslash}"usler-Reiss parameter matrix. Further, the results enable parametric inference for Brown-Resnick processes. A simulation study compares the performance of the new estimators to other commonly used methods. As an application, we fit a non-isotropic Brown-Resnick process to the extremes of 12 year data of daily wind speed measurements.},

The theory of multivariate and spatial extremes describes the risk of rare events through asymptotically justified limit models such as max-stable and multivariate Pareto distributions. Statistical modelling in this field has been limited to moderate dimensions so far, partly owing to complicated likelihoods and a lack of understanding of the underlying probabilistic structures. We introduce a general theory of conditional independence for multivariate Pareto distributions that enables the definition of graphical models and sparsity for extremes. A Hammersley--Clifford theorem links this new notion to the factorization of densities of extreme value models on graphs. For the popular class of H{\"u}sler--Reiss distributions we show that, similarly to the Gaussian case, the sparsity pattern of a general extremal graphical model can be read off from suitable inverse covariance matrices. New parametric models can be built in a modular way and statistical inference can be simplified to lower dimensional marginals. We discuss learning of minimum spanning trees and model selection for extremal graph structures, and we illustrate their use with an application to flood risk assessment on the Danube river.},

  abstract = {Statistical inference for extremes has been a subject of intensive research over the past couple of decades. One approach is based on modelling exceedances of a random variable over a high threshold with the generalized Pareto (GP) distribution. This has proved to be an important way to apply extreme value theory in practice and is widely used. We introduce a multivariate analogue of the GP distribution and show that it is characterized by each of following two properties: first, exceedances asymptotically have a multivariate GP distribution if and only if maxima asymptotically are extreme value distributed; and second, the multivariate GP distribution is the only one which is preserved under change of exceedance levels. We also discuss a bivariate example and lower-dimensional marginal distributions.},

  abstract = {Positive dependence is present in many real world data sets and has appealing stochastic properties that can be exploited in statistical modeling and in estimation. In particular, the notion of multivariate total positivity of order 2 (\$ {\textbackslash}mathrm\{MTP\}\_\{2\} \$) is a convex constraint and acts as an implicit regularizer in the Gaussian case. We study positive dependence in multivariate extremes and introduce \$ {\textbackslash}mathrm\{EMTP\}\_\{2\} \$, an extremal version of \$ {\textbackslash}mathrm\{MTP\}\_\{2\} \$. This notion turns out to appear prominently in extremes, and in fact, it is satisfied by many classical models. For a H{\textbackslash}"usler--Reiss distribution, the analogue of a Gaussian distribution in extremes, we show that it is \$ {\textbackslash}mathrm\{EMTP\}\_\{2\} \$ if and only if its precision matrix is a Laplacian of a connected graph. We propose an estimator for the parameters of the H{\textbackslash}"usler--Reiss distribution under \$ {\textbackslash}mathrm\{EMTP\}\_\{2\} \$ as the solution of a convex optimization problem with Laplacian constraint. We prove that this estimator is consistent and typically yields a sparse model with possibly nondecomposable extremal graphical structure. Applying our methods to a data set of Danube River flows, we illustrate this regularization and the superior performance compared to existing methods.},

We will see how max-stable processes are defined through a simple spectral representation and how it is possible to derive the finite dimensional distributions from it. Because the goal of this crash course is also to be of practical interest, existing parametric max-stable models will be introduced and discussed. A useful measure of spatial dependence, the extremal coefficient function, will be introduced as well as several approaches to fit max-stable processes to spatial data. Finally we open the discussion with other alternatives to max-stable processes to model spatial extremes.},

  abstract = {Graphical models serve as effective tools for visualizing conditional dependencies between variables. However, as the number of variables grows, interpretation becomes increasingly difficult, and estimation uncertainty increases due to the large number of parameters relative to the number of observations. To address these challenges, we introduce the Clusterpath estimator of the Gaussian Graphical Model (CGGM) that encourages variable clustering in the graphical model in a data-driven way. Through the use of a clusterpath penalty, we group variables together, which in turn results in a block-structured precision matrix whose block structure remains preserved in the covariance matrix. We present a computationally efficient implementation of the CGGM estimator by using a cyclic block coordinate descent algorithm. In simulations, we show that CGGM not only matches, but oftentimes outperforms other state-of-the-art methods for variable clustering in graphical models. We also demonstrate CGGM's practical advantages and versatility on a diverse collection of empirical applications.},
